= Itunes Movie Server

This is a little application that creates a media RSS of the Movie contents of your iTunes Music Library. It uses sqlite by default.

It is very much a work in progress, where I hope to be able to stream the (non-DRM) content in my iTunes machine straight to my Roku on the other room.

Simply start the server and visit the top level. If you see a list of videos, it means things worked. If not, play with the constants in the source (or create Options records) to match the settings (I'll be adding a config page soon) to point to the correct locations of things.

This expects you to have added your Movies library as a symlink on Apache. I did that on my machine as follows:

  <Directory "/Users/david/Sites/">
	  Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
	  AllowOverride None
	  Order allow,deny
	  Allow from all
  </Directory>

And making a symbolic link in ~/Sites as follows:

  iTunesMovies -> ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music/Movies

The regular pages are very basic. To visit the XML versions of the pages (the ones you point your roku to), visit:

	http://your-server/movies?format=rss

or

  http://your-server/movies/genres?format=rss

(Again, you may have to adjust paths to match your locations)

Have fun!
